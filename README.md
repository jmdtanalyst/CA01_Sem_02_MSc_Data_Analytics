**Abstract**

Traditional time series models struggle with the complexities of bike-sharing trip data. This research proposes a scalable Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach for daily trip prediction using Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing. It addresses the challenge of irregular data by transforming it into a format suitable for RNN analysis.

**Introduction**

Bike-sharing programs require accurate daily trip demand forecasts. Established models like ARIMA can be limiting. This research explores RNNs, a powerful class of machine learning models suited for time series analysis due to their ability to handle temporal dependencies.

**Objective**

This research aims to develop a highly accurate and efficient forecasting system using RNNs and scalable computing to benefit bike-sharing companies by enabling them to:

* Optimize resource allocation
* Ensure bike availability
* Improve user experience

**Research Question**

Can RNNs, utilizing Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing, outperform traditional time series forecasting models in predicting daily bike-sharing trip demand, particularly when considering irregular data and missing values?

**Neural Networks for Forecasting**

Neural networks are widely used for various tasks, including time series forecasting. They can learn complex, non-linear relationships in data.

**Why RNNs for Time Series?**

Regular neural networks process information in a single pass. RNNs address this by incorporating a feedback loop, allowing them to use past information for predictions.

**Challenges and Solutions**

Simple RNNs can struggle with long-term dependencies. To overcome this, LSTMs and GRUs have emerged:

* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** LSTMs incorporate special gating mechanisms that allow them to selectively remember and forget information over long periods, making them ideal for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
* **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):** Similar to LSTMs, GRUs use gating mechanisms to control information flow within the network. They are generally simpler and faster to train than LSTMs.

**Apache Hadoop and PySpark for Scalable Processing**

Bike-sharing data can be vast. Traditional computing platforms might struggle to handle such large datasets efficiently. This is where Apache Hadoop and PySpark come into play.

* **Apache Hadoop:** An open-source framework that facilitates distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
* **PySpark:** A powerful distributed computing framework built on top of Apache Hadoop. It offers a Python-like API for data processing tasks.


* **Data Acquisition**
    * Source: Capital Bikeshare historical data ([https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)) under Capital Bikeshare Data License Agreement.
    * Advantages: Easy to collect, free to use.
    * Disadvantages: Not automatically updated, requires manual download and analysis.
* **Model Selection and Architecture**
    * Two RNN architectures were explored: LSTM and GRU.
    * The choice between LSTM and GRU depends on factors like data complexity and computational resources.

**Future Work**

* Implement data preprocessing steps using PySpark.
* Develop and train LSTM and GRU models using TensorFlow.
* Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Compare the performance of RNN models with traditional time series models.

This research has the potential to develop a highly accurate and efficient forecasting system for bike-sharing companies. Future work will involve implementing the remaining sections and drawing conclusions based on the findings.
