# Recurrent Neural Network for Bike-Sharing Time Series Analysis

This project investigates the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for daily bike-sharing trip demand prediction using Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing.


- **Abstract:**
    Traditional time series forecasting models, like ARIMA, are popular due to their ease of use. However, RNNs offer a more powerful approach. This research proposes a scalable RNN-based method for daily bike-sharing trip prediction that leverages Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing. A significant challenge lies in the irregularity of bike-sharing data, characterized by fluctuating demand patterns and missing values. This research addresses this challenge with data engineering techniques to transform the data into a regular, daily format suitable for RNN analysis.

## Introduction

The rise of bike-sharing programs has revolutionized urban transportation. However, efficient program management requires accurate forecasting of daily bike trip demand. Established time series models like ARIMA struggle to capture the complexities of bike-sharing data, which is often irregular due to factors like weather, seasonality, and special events.

## Research Objectives

This research explores the potential of RNNs for daily bike-sharing trip prediction. RNNs are a powerful class of machine learning models adept at learning complex patterns from sequential data. Their ability to handle temporal dependencies makes them well-suited for analyzing time series data like bike-sharing trips. This project proposes a scalable RNN-based approach that leverages Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing. This allows us to efficiently process large-scale bike-sharing datasets and explore different RNN architectures for accurate prediction. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and efficient forecasting system to benefit bike-sharing companies by enabling them to:

1. Optimize resource allocation
2. Ensure bike availability
3. Improve user experience

## Research Question

Can RNNs, utilizing Apache Hadoop and PySpark for distributed computing, outperform traditional time series forecasting models in predicting daily bike-sharing trip demand, particularly when considering the challenges of irregular data and missing values?
