# Enhancing Mail Classification Efficiency: A CNN-based Approach for Handwritten Character Recognition

## Description

This project aims to enhance mail classification efficiency by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for robust handwritten character recognition (HWR). The project utilizes:

- **CNNs:** To achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits and capital letters even with diverse writing styles and potentially challenging image quality.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** As the primary development environment, enabling interactive coding, experimentation, and visualization.
- **Hadoop integration:** For handling large datasets by modifying the notebook code to access and process data stored on HDFS.

## Features

- **Scalable and Adaptable:** Designed to handle growing datasets and adapt to different postal address formats through modularity and potential hyperparameter tuning.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Integrates techniques like image resizing and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation:** Provides performance metrics like accuracy on a separate test dataset.

## Further Considerations

This project serves as a foundation for HWR in mail classification.
